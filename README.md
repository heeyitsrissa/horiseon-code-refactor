# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description
This code refactor was done in part to make the website more accessible to viewers with impaired vision, it was also done to clean up the code and make sure it met all the clients needs.

## Installation
The first thing required for this project was to make sure all background and font colors were visible for people who are visually impair, which i was able to check with the who can see website and pick the color that was close to the original color but would be better visible for all who would visit the site. Next I replaced the non-semantic HTML elements with the proper semantic elements to properly label the layout. After I found all non decorative images that would be used for the website and added it to the HTML so an alt text could be added. Then I moved back to my CSS Stylesheet and started to clean up and combine classes that were the same style to compact the code and make it look neater, lastly I made sure the unordered list was horizontal and across from the title of the page not underneath it.

## Usage
This website will be used by businesses looking to improve their SEO, and social media marketing to find more clients and grow their business.
